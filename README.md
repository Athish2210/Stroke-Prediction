Welcome to the Stroke Prediction Project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual having a stroke based on various health-related features. The dataset used for training and testing the model is included in the repository.

## Introduction

Stroke is a critical health condition, and early prediction can significantly improve the chances of prevention and effective treatment. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the probability of an individual experiencing a stroke based on their health parameters.

## Dataset

The dataset (`stroke_data.csv`) contains various features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, and body mass index (BMI), among others. The target variable is the "stroke" column, indicating whether a stroke occurred (1) or not (0).

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for model development and analysis)

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`stroke_prediction.ipynb`) to explore the dataset and understand the steps taken in the project.

2. Execute the notebook cells to load the data, preprocess it, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using the Scikit-learn library. The notebook includes code for data preprocessing, feature scaling, model selection, and training.

```python
# Example code snippet for model training
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = df.drop('stroke', axis=1)
y = df['stroke']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

## Evaluation

The notebook contains sections for model evaluation, where metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix are calculated. Analyze these metrics to understand the model's performance.

## Results

The notebook contains sections for results, insights, or challenges encountered during the project. Discuss the implications of the model's predictions and potential use cases in real-world scenarios.
